# Frontend TODO

### Polishing
* Use modals instead of javascript's `window.confirm()`
* Use the window/frame more effectively. 

### Scoreboard List
* When I list scoreboards, I should default to filter only active games

### Player List
* If I click a player from the list, I should be able to go to Single Player View

### Single Player View
* Should show me match history for this player
